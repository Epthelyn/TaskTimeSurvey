Timestamp	Are you a Taskman or Taskmain?	What is your current Taskman tier?	Which days does this usually apply to? If your answer is "None of the above", respond to the follow-up questions with "No time".	On an average work day, how much time do you spend ACTIVELY playing the game in such a way that you're giving the game your full attention and NOT, for example, watching a  movie or YouTube on another screen or device? Choose the closest time that applies.	On the same kind of day, how much time do you spend playing the game in a way that requires enough attention not to be "AFK" but allows for intermittent but regular breaks and distractions from  other screens/devices/activities, or chasing higher-activity bonuses like rockertunities while mining? Choose the closest time that applies.	On the same kind of day, how much time do you spend playing the game very inactively/"AFK" This is any time where you're barely paying attention and can have the game in the background, on another screen for extended periods without interaction, possibly with something like AFKWarden warning you about lobby timeouts?

How much do you agree with the statements: "If I had more time to actively play, I would spend most of the extra time participating in or completing [...]" [Group activities (Future group PvM, minigames, placeholders etc.)]	How much do you agree with the statements: "If I had more time to actively play, I would spend most of the extra time participating in or completing [...]" [My active (usually solo) task]	How much do you agree with the statement: "Task time should be an important factor in determining the tier of a task. Longer tasks should be in higher tiers or split up into more manageable smaller tasks" [Question]
